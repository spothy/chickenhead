      I'm not a fan of big words, but I'm definitely a sucker when it comes to great stories.
      So the time you shared with me, that fragment about Simone and Sartre's relationship it
      somehow hit a nerve. I thought it was beautiful and refreshing. Especially when there's
      a mention of how they both were stimulated by the other and their openness.
      <br><br>
      So with that in mind, and knowing that I'm not as open as I would like to be,
      I thought it would be nice to have a place where I can put words or images around my
      feelings and thoughts. This is a place for us, where you can always reach me and where you
      can be sure that every word I'm sending on your direction comes straight out of my heart.
      Even though I might play heavy on the abstract and lyrical.
      <br><br>
      Yours truly,
      <br><br>

          I really want you to like me, you know? I can imagine myself,
          on a Sunday evening, calling my friends with a stupid smile
          on my face and telling them that we got a cat.
          A beautiful cat named Simone. I'm a daydreamer, and
          I don't know if that's good or bad. Like the times where my
          heart aches cause I've been holding my breath on this unrealistic
          image of us and then I remember I'm stuck in mother fucking planet Earth.
          I laugh a lot, but I don't think everything is funny. I cry sometimes,
          and I've found shelter in your kind words and jokes.
          <br> <br>

          I really want you to like me, cause your birthday felt like mine and
          who doesn't want to have two special days every year. Well... there might be
          some people, and probably there's a podcast about them. Maybe you would like it,
          and therefore I would listen to it and still prefer your version of it.
          Next month I'll be older, probably a little bit more boring and definitely,
          I'll remain a horrendous cook. <br><br>

          Wouldn't you agree we would be a fantastic live duet? Sometimes I give you sad kisses,
          thinking that there's a parallel world where I screwed up, and these kinds of moments
          are off the table. Even sadder kisses, if I think I'm living in that world. There are
          times that I feel big, and there are others where I can fit inside a shirt pocket. That's
          why I really want you to like me.
          <br> <br>
          I have friends and trust issues. Occasionally, I feel like an idiot when I'm speaking English.
          Which is good... sometimes. I like listening to other smart people, and I love that you are willing
          to talk to me. I have my virtues, and I can scream with my eyes -I really like you B. Hopefully,
          you can really like me back and who knows, maybe later we can have a second cat. <br> <br>

          Yours truly,<br>
          G funky

Bon Iver - Sh'Diah <br> <br>

I'm inside the plane, and this old lady is sitting on my seat. I chose to sit by the window.
Even more, I did everything that was on my hands to make sure I could stare into the sky during
 my 10-hour flight.  I can't remember properly, but in my mind, I think I asked her in a very chivalrous way to
 move her ass away from my seat.  <br> <br>

As lame as it may sound, I've always been fascinated by clouds. The way they expand towards the horizon,
the patterns, the white shadows, and the bluish contrast. It's almost painful that something
so majestic vanishes as soon as you touch it. As soon as it becomes real. I don't
trust my eyes nor my mind. I see as far as my mind lets me, and I think everything
is as I see it.  My heart is alright, tho. If only I could close my eyes and become
as ethereal as an Atlantic cloud. Expand, break, stick, flow, transform, bounce,
disappear, and kidnap the sun during kid's birthday parties. I would see everything
from a distance, a cloud with a soul, holding secrets, feelings, and anxiety.
A decent cloud that would do good as well; I would be a gloomy afternoon for the
ones in need of comfort; a feisty rain for the lovers on the street. I would stalk
a lot of people. Like I would eavesdrop the shit out of the people that I love.
I'd do it as they step on me as a puddle and on my way up to being a cloud after
a rainy summer day. I would feed out of their tears and make myself heard
during their awkward silences. I would be all of that and still feel very sad.
I would be a cloud craving to be a human just to be seen. <br> <br>

I think the seat thief on my right is not impressed with my writing. So if you are reading this,
Salvadorean lady, know that I'm hangover and a little bit heartbroken.  <br> <br>

I hate how we speak of time as if we actually knew shit about it. Like how can three weeks
fit in a second, and 15 days can feel like a kick in the cunt. Time goes and never returns, used to say,
my 8th-grade teacher. A lovely lady, that flew all the way from the UK to spend her
adulthood surrounded by Latino rascals. She got her hip replaced when she was 50,
and every day, it took her 30 minutes to reach our classroom after the recess.
She had green eyes, and her heart was as big as a watermelon. A sweet deep voice
and an overwhelming appreciation for life. She lost her husband at a young age,
and sometimes she would take some minutes to ramble about her lost love. Time never
seemed to bother her. I remember, everyday she wore the emeralds bracelets that
her dear bought for her. She said time goes and never returns, and still, she
had golden seconds hanging out of her wrist. <br> <br>

Imagine life without the concept of time. Think about prisoners getting their freedom
back, only if they've truly changed. A world ready for eternal love and ageless romance.
It sounds very impractical, to be honest, and a free-for-all playground for sexual predators. <br> <br>

We all pretend to know what abstract concepts are and what they are not. Maybe it's relative,
and in reality, we all are philosophers. Or perhaps not, and we all know that other's
are dumber than we are, and we just can't be bother to give a shit about other people's idiocy.
We can't change people's reality.  For instance, I'm sure nobody in this plane can prove me
wrong when I say that right now, while I'm sitting next to the window,  playing solitaire,
I'm also in the last Thursday morning, underneath my bedsheets, feeling blessed next to my
sweetheart. I'm mother fucking certain that nobody from this 200 people crowd can deny that
while I'm typing these words, I'm also in next weekend lousy Guatemala waiting for my loved
one to reply to this that I'm writing now. I mean, they can try, they can say shit to me,
they can touch me and therefore bring me back to the stupid 48A seat, but I only need one
moment to diverge and be far away, holding my partner's hand while drinking wine on a
Stockholm summer evening.  As a last resource, they can join forces, and decide to take
turns to poke me with a stick so that I could only be where they can see me.  Or perhaps,
they can prove me wrong and I'm an idiot pretending to have deep thoughts on a transatlantic
flight. Maybe I am, and I'm not, maybe I'm infinite like the clouds outside of my window.
